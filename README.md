# Dobby-security-audit

I have designed a WordPress plugin that uses the Dobby API to analyze your website and categorize your site's security problems, such as the need for site updates, risky plugins, access, etc., into three categories: high risk, medium risk, and low risk, and also tells you the solution to fix these security problems.
